<h3 id="independent-coffee-roasters-and-coffee-shops-around-the-national-taiwan-university-ntu-or-taida-and-the-daan-and-zhongzhen-area">Independent coffee roasters and coffee shops around the National Taiwan University (NTU or Taida) and the Da’an and Zhongzhen area.</h3>

<p>How to read this coffee list:</p>

<p>The independent cafes on this list were visited during a trip in Spring 2017. Below, you will find a photo of the cafe space, a brief profile of what they offer, and the location on Google Maps.</p>

<p>My map includes 3 types of information. 1) The cafes I’d go to for coffee; 2) the cafes with decent enough coffee, but I would go to for additional reasons (i.e. remote work, food, or ambiance), and 3) other places in the area I like.</p>

<p>The places on this list don’t follow a set of criteria. Usually, I look for places with good coffee, comfortable seating, friendly staff, plugs and Wi-Fi, and good food. Most places average out to being decent enough for a revisit depending on what I’m in the mood for. I try to note in this list exactly what I like about it to help people make a decision.</p>

<p>Other Tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taipei has a lot of free Wi-Fi (metro if you register, restaurants, cafes, and public spaces). Also, ask if you don’t see the Wi-Fi password.</li>
  <li>The area around National Taiwan University (NTU / Taida) has a lot of cafes, so you can just wander around the Guting, Tai Power Building metro stations.</li>
  <li>Cafes open late in Taipei. Most open after 10am and stay open until 10pm or even midnight.</li>
  <li>Many cafes are used to people working for hours. The places that don’t allow it usually will inform you of how long you can stay.</li>
  <li>Some places will have a minimum charge and coffee is often more expensive than food.</li>
  <li>English is not widely spoken in Taipei. Most of these cafes have some English on the menu, but the local restaurants I’ve recommended often don’t.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rufous Coffee</strong>
Of the best cafes I’ve visited in Taipei so far, Rufous is definitely in the top 3 (although I can’t rank my favourites firmly). They’re quite pricey for their single origin pour-overs, but the cup I got was delicious. The place has a more classic approach to a coffee house, with a wooden interior, shelf crammed with memorabilia, cups and coffee equipment.</p>

<p>Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso, syphon
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available, maybe one or two outlets
Hours:	13:00-22:00
Closed Thursdays
Address:	No. 339, Section 2, Fuxing South Road, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106</p>

<p><strong>Hi日楞 Ryou Cafe</strong>
Things I like about Hi Ryou are that it opens early (8:30am), is spacious and green, and has generously portioned food with local and seasonal ingredients. This place requires each patron to at least buy 1 drink, but has free Wi-Fi and outlets along the window seats. This is a popular remote working place.</p>

<p>Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available. Outlets along the walls
Hours:	8:30-19:00
Closed Tuesdays
Address:	No. 24-1, Pucheng Street, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106</p>

<p><strong>早秋咖啡 Cafe Macho</strong>
Come if you like cafe / bars that cater to local student and artist communities (think indie performance posters, manga books, retro decore). This place also has Wi-Fi and individual outlets and stays open late for night owl remote workers. Their espresso-based drinks are also reasonably priced in comparison to other lifestyle cafes in the area.</p>

<p>Coffee:	Espresso
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available, work station outlets available.
Hours:	Daily 12:00-00:00
Address:	No. 10, Jinjiang St, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100</p>

<p><strong>山田咖啡 Yamada Coffee</strong>
One of the best filter coffees in the city and at great value because this is basically a takeaway shop. As roasters who began as importers of Kono coffee equipment, they also import Kanazawa water pots (which cost over US$200 and I haven’t found anywhere else outside of Kanazawa City in Japan). They have smelling vials for their roasts, which make a great souvenir to take home. Drop by if you’re in the area, but it’s not for remote work.</p>

<p>Coffee:	Single-origin pour over (Kono &amp; Kanazawa methods)
Remote Work:	Not suitable.
Hours:	8:00-19:30
Closed Tuesdays
Address:	No. 18, Section 2, Roosevelt Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100</p>

<p><strong>Paper Street Coffee Company</strong>
This cafe is a bit further from the other ones on the list, but I’ve included it because it would be a shame if you missed out! Located across the street from Huashan 1914 Cultural District, it’s a refuge from the crowds. Many bloggers tout it as the best espresso in the city. While the cup I tried wasn’t anywhere near that, it was decent enough for me to definitely return and try a second time, since I like the atmosphere it has at night. Note, it has no Wi-Fi, but does have 1-2 plugs for remote work.</p>

<p>Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso
Remote Work:	A few outlets in corners
Hours:	Daily: 10:00-20:00
Address:	No. 28, Section 1, Bade Road, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 10058</p>

<p><strong>Wisteria House</strong> is one of my favourite places to lounge at, but it’s a tea house. 
The entire area around Taida (NTU) and Shida has affordable local eats. If you want a cozy sit-down place, the dining cafes beside NTU are a great bet – plus, many double up as great lounge bars and have live music at night.</p>

<p>In my map, look for the fork and knife icon for places to eat. Most of them are quite local and more on the street-food end. I have added notes in the map location pins.</p>
