The map I created includes restaurants that I could find back in 2016 as well as places of worship throughout Tokyo for people who lived there.

Since I created this map, many more resources have been made available to the Muslim community in Japan. 

### Apps
#### [Halal Gourmet Japan](https://www.halalgourmet.jp/) [English] [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/halal-gourmet-japan/id1004830156?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.halalgourmet.mobile&hl=en_US)
1000+ Halal restaurants in Japan for travellers from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Middle East. While many Japanese may be meat-free because they are seafood based, only a handful of places serve Halal meat. 

#### Halal Navi [English] [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/halal-navi/id887385257?mt=8) | [Android]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halalnavi&hl=en_US))
Halal Navi is created by the same group that does NaviTime, one of Japan's most locally popular transit apps. The app also has “Halal tips”.

#### Happy Cow [English] [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/happycow-find-vegan-food/id435871950?mt=8) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sisow.hcvg.healthydiningguide)
Mostly Japanese cafe style or Western-inspired food, but safe.

### General Food Chains:
