I had created this map for Halal restaurants and other places of interst to Muslims in Tokyo (such as places of worship).

You’ll find restaurants, mosques, and prayer rooms marked. I also created a [vegetarian restaurants in Tokyo](https://thecupandtheroad.com/2016/02/10/vegetarian-restaurants-tokyo/) guide to expand the places people can eat at.

Japan now has Muslim-friendly apps and guides, so it's more likely that those will be of use, but this map is useful if you want to save it to your Google Map and not toggle back and forth.
