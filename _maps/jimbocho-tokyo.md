Tokyo's "Booktown" crams 200 bookstores within a 15-minute walk radius, about 1/3 of Tokyo's all second hand bookstores. It's a cultural pocket from the Meiji Era has everything from the 100 Yen manga books to thousand dollar collectible antiques. Whether you have an hour or a whole day, check out a few in the list below, then follow the red pins to local restaurants on the map (because it is a source of great student-budget eats).

*Note: Pins in green are book stores and pins in red are restaurants!*
{: .notice--success}

You'll find the stacks of used books if you hit up Yasukuni-dori and Hakusan-dori and just wander every little side street to see what other little shops catch your fancy. The area starts just north of the Imperial Palace and skirts along the edges of Iidabashi's eateries. Tokyo’s university ghetto is surrounded by Hitotsubashi, Meiji, and Nihon, Chuo, and Senshu University and has a town of bookstores, eateries, and sports shops to serve students and academics alike.

This second hand book area hails from the Meiji Era around the 1870s. Initially the resellers specialised in law books and collectible books to meet the demands of the new universities, but quickly diversified in stock and numbers to meet the universities' growing needs. Many venerable shops will have establishment dates from the 20th or even 19th century, but have gregarious 1970s facades. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 levelled many shops, but even the ones that survived would have been burned during Tokyo's fire raids in World War II. They have since rebuilt and vary in size and style, and specialties. Jimbocho is one of my favourite places in Tokyo and an area I return to often. This list and map have been updated last in 2020.
