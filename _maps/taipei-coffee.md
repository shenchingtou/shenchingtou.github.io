## The Coffee Notes

### Independent coffee roasters and coffee shops around the National Taiwan University (NTU or Taida) and the Da'an and Zhongzhen area. 

How to read this coffee list:

The independent cafes on this list were visited during a trip in Spring 2017. Below, you will find a photo of the cafe space, a brief profile of what they offer, and the location on Google Maps.

My map includes 3 types of information. 1) The cafes I'd go to for coffee; 2) the cafes with decent enough coffee, but I would go to for additional reasons (i.e. remote work, food, or ambiance), and 3) other places in the area I like.

The places on this list don't follow a set of criteria. Usually, I look for places with good coffee, comfortable seating, friendly staff, plugs and Wi-Fi, and good food. Most places average out to being decent enough for a revisit depending on what I'm in the mood for. I try to note in this list exactly what I like about it to help people make a decision.

Other Tips:

- Taipei has a lot of free Wi-Fi (metro if you register, restaurants, cafes, and public spaces). Also, ask if you don't see the Wi-Fi password.
- The area around National Taiwan University (NTU / Taida) has a lot of cafes, so you can just wander around the Guting, Tai Power Building metro stations.
- Cafes open late in Taipei. Most open after 10am and stay open until 10pm or even midnight.
- Many cafes are used to people working for hours. The places that don't allow it usually will inform you of how long you can stay.
- Some places will have a minimum charge and coffee is often more expensive than food.
- English is not widely spoken in Taipei. Most of these cafes have some English on the menu, but the local restaurants I've recommended often don't.

**Rufous Coffee**
Of the best cafes I've visited in Taipei so far, Rufous is definitely in the top 3 (although I can't rank my favourites firmly). They're quite pricey for their single origin pour-overs, but the cup I got was delicious. The place has a more classic approach to a coffee house, with a wooden interior, shelf crammed with memorabilia, cups and coffee equipment.

Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso, syphon
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available, maybe one or two outlets
Hours:	13:00-22:00
Closed Thursdays
Address:	No. 339, Section 2, Fuxing South Road, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106


**Hi日楞 Ryou Cafe**
Things I like about Hi Ryou are that it opens early (8:30am), is spacious and green, and has generously portioned food with local and seasonal ingredients. This place requires each patron to at least buy 1 drink, but has free Wi-Fi and outlets along the window seats. This is a popular remote working place.

Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available. Outlets along the walls
Hours:	8:30-19:00
Closed Tuesdays
Address:	No. 24-1, Pucheng Street, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106

**早秋咖啡 Cafe Macho**
Come if you like cafe / bars that cater to local student and artist communities (think indie performance posters, manga books, retro decore). This place also has Wi-Fi and individual outlets and stays open late for night owl remote workers. Their espresso-based drinks are also reasonably priced in comparison to other lifestyle cafes in the area.

Coffee:	Espresso
Remote Work:	Wi-Fi available, work station outlets available.
Hours:	Daily 12:00-00:00
Address:	No. 10, Jinjiang St, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100

**山田咖啡 Yamada Coffee**
One of the best filter coffees in the city and at great value because this is basically a takeaway shop. As roasters who began as importers of Kono coffee equipment, they also import Kanazawa water pots (which cost over US$200 and I haven't found anywhere else outside of Kanazawa City in Japan). They have smelling vials for their roasts, which make a great souvenir to take home. Drop by if you're in the area, but it's not for remote work.

Coffee:	Single-origin pour over (Kono & Kanazawa methods)
Remote Work:	Not suitable.
Hours:	8:00-19:30
Closed Tuesdays
Address:	No. 18, Section 2, Roosevelt Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100

**Paper Street Coffee Company**
This cafe is a bit further from the other ones on the list, but I've included it because it would be a shame if you missed out! Located across the street from Huashan 1914 Cultural District, it's a refuge from the crowds. Many bloggers tout it as the best espresso in the city. While the cup I tried wasn't anywhere near that, it was decent enough for me to definitely return and try a second time, since I like the atmosphere it has at night. Note, it has no Wi-Fi, but does have 1-2 plugs for remote work.

Coffee:	Single-origin pour over, espresso
Remote Work:	A few outlets in corners
Hours:	Daily: 10:00-20:00
Address:	No. 28, Section 1, Bade Road, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 10058

**Wisteria House** is one of my favourite places to lounge at, but it's a tea house. 
The entire area around Taida (NTU) and Shida has affordable local eats. If you want a cozy sit-down place, the dining cafes beside NTU are a great bet -- plus, many double up as great lounge bars and have live music at night.

In my map, look for the fork and knife icon for places to eat. Most of them are quite local and more on the street-food end. I have added notes in the map location pins.
