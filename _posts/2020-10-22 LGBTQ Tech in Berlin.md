Where does one even begin for LGBTQ-friendliness of tech companies? Tech is (supposedly) as a young industry, where there's more openness and freedom -- in theory. Berlin has a reputation of being a haven for subcultures and the queer community. But how do these perceptions actually play out on the ground of lived experiences?

### Berlin's Tech Community and Events
I haven't been in Berlin long and have attended in-person events between 2019 Q3 and 2020 Q1. My personal impression is that Berlin's tech community is implicitly LGBTQ-friendly. Below are some of the ways I notice LGBTQ visibility and influence:
- queer people in the audience (probably 100% of events I've been to)
- presenters who happen to be queer
- [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/) in event description & reminder on event day (available in EN/DE/ES/PL/FR/IT/RU/JP/AR)
- pronoun stickers / introductions 

Some example of events I've been to with queer presenters:
- [WiDS Berlin 2020](https://colloq.io/events/wids-berlin/2020/kreuzberg/1) (which I co-hosted)
- [A11y Berlin Meetup #9](https://a11y-meetup-berlin.de/meetups)
- [Unicorns in Tech](https://app.unicornsintech.com/) and other [Uhlala](https://uhlala.com/en/events-calendar/) events

Apart from the Uhlala events, many of the tech events I go to are not LGBTQ-focused.

### Tech Groups to Check Out
Because I would say the general tech community, as defined by groups in tech rather than companies, is generally LGBTQ-friendly, I generally find that ones led by women or people of colour also tend to be more inclusive. Because I don't drink and am not much of a night owl, this list skews heavily towards professional groups and gorups for women/trans/non-binary folks rather than general LGBTQ social groups (which should be searchable based on your interests).

### What about Berlin's tech companies?

By taking this Code of Conduct, the hosts have committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof). The event host, in theory, has made explicit that the event invites participants to create safe and positive experiences for everyone and reserves the right to remove people who have unacceptable behaviour (clearly listed). At a number of events, the Code of Conduct is mentioned at the opening.
