Got my first [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/athena) and used it to try out the cafe at my intersection. Picked up bread from a bakery and dropped it off at the homeless dropoff point.

Also cleaned my bike, went to get kimchi, and pumped my bike tire.

Then, I wasted a good two hours fixing my page build because of an indentation error on this blog. It required trouble shooting to a full reversion.
