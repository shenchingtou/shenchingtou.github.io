Even though East Asia has a reputation of cramming too much text into its websites and contents, I find that some of my favourite note taking services come from this region.

The absolute favourite is [**HackMD**](https://hackmd.io/), which is built by a Taiwanese team ([of students!](https://hackmd.io/@jkyang/Bk-zpEC9-?type=view)). It's not easy to find the info if you don't go to [Github](https://github.com/orgs/hackmdio/people), but clicking on the last person to edit the app's tutorial will get you to one of the co-founders, [Yukai](https://hackmd.io/@yukai), which leads you to another, [Max](https://hackmd.io/@MaxWu). In the early years, when HackPad still existed (HackMD credits them as inspiration), the whole team was a bit more accessible. I remember someone being based in Japan. HackMD is much better than HackPad. For one thing, it's feature list is insane. It also has the best documentation.

It now has [Hatena Bookmark](https://b.hatena.ne.jp/), Hatena Fotolife, [Hatena Keyword](https://d.hatena.ne.jp/).

They also have their [Design Staff Blog](https://design.hatenastaff.com/) and [Developer Blog](https://staff.hatenablog.com/)

I am in awe that a Japanese app managed to get top-level one-word domain. More likely, they paid a royal sum for whomever had parked it previously. 
They also created the creator's platform: [Cakes](https://cakes.mu/) < kind of like Medium.

A side note: checking up on HackMD again, I discovered the [Small Chat App](https://small.chat/), the best chat solution I've ever encountered for someone like me.
