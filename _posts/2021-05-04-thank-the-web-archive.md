description: The things I've kept when I deleted my old blog.
---


When I promised to delete my blog by the end of 2020, I thought I would have nothing better to do. I got side tracked by employment and people. 

It was no fun to me to figure out a bulk export script for my text, images, and maps from wordpress to Jekyll and Hugo. 

Even though I keep thinking I am new to blogging, my domain is seven years old. It is not young, it is not old. "A viable, die-able age" as Roy put it in *The God of Small Things*. For a while, a post explaining the Tokyo Subway Pass had a lot of traffic because no-one else seemed to want to explain how it worked. I suppose it feels new because the design was never as I wanted; the traffic is not as high as new bloggers who started in the year of Covid-19; I have never outgrown my ambivalence to whom I was making this information available to. 

Despite the ambvialence, I had published over 200 posts and pages. Some 50 were related to the [Shikoku Pilgrimage, which has been migrated](https://shenchingtou.github.io/shikoku/). Even though I'd tried my hand at other posts, that was the seed that actually took root for a blog to grow. I diversified to cafe reviews, which probably numbered close to 100 at peak. It is like the mint I planted for fun in my mom's garden -- an easy weed to grow that overtakes everything else. They were the first batch that I dumped a few years back. Every successive cafe deletion has felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders. I was taking up less server space, creating less traffic, removing unnecessary middle-class expat attention to places that had been founded for local communities. The last set were LGBTQ and Chinese-language resources. 

Like most of my projects, this one remains 80% finished. But since my subscription expires this month and it's a good a time as any to bury this skeleton.

Manually deleting everything takes time. It is not efficient in a world obsessed with automation. Though I have loathed the tedium, I would like to take the time. I would like to take the time to say goodbye to these memories. Many I only remember when they come across my screen. Like my documentation of local tokyo; settling in Hong Kong.
