Recently, I checked up on one of the only bloggers I ever check up on Kat Davis, writer of the [Following the Arrows](https://followingthearrows.com/2020/07/16/a-tribute-to-kat-hummingbird-davis/), only to find out she passed away on February 28 this year. It was a shock.

She walked the [Shikoku Pilgrimage in 2014](https://followingthearrows.com/shikoku-88-temple-pilgrimage/) and it contributed to her motivation to build [her blog and pilgrimage resources in English](https://followingthearrows.com/shikoku-88-temple-pilgrimage/). She was one of two bloggers who made it possible for me to do my own years ago. She shares about the [people she had met](https://followingthearrows.com/2014/09/22/day-31-temples-54-55-25km-shikoku-88-temple-pilgrimage/) and she accompanies her readers along the routes they walk.

Though I've never met Kat, her character shone through her writing, her Instagram photos. Her voice lives in her interviews.
