  description: I returned to Hong Kong and focused exclusively on B2B content marketing, 
               working with engineer-led companies that wanted to translate technical and 
               digital product expertise for business-focused clients. I also focused on working with 
               Chinese-to-English teams to help bridge building.

  description: As I'd always wanted to write and live in Japan, I took time out to 
               walk the Shikoku Pilgrimage and live in rural Japan. I began my blog, which
               attracted the attention of a Japan travel platform. 
               I began with B2C content marketing and moved into B2B content marketing.

  description: Instead of advising startups, I wanted to help them build their businesses
               hands on. I took up project work and spent time in Shenzhen, Thailand, and Yangon.
               Companies I worked with included LaunchPilots (exited 2017), Social Impact Myanmar 
               (later ImpactHub Yangon), and Teach for China.

  description: Moved to Hong Kong. Got my first job and frustrated quickly with the education system, 
               so I co-founded TEDxYouth@HongKong (later TEDxYouth@VictoriaHarbour), which ran for 10 years.
               I also worked in venture philanthropy and impact investment before it became an industry in Hong Kong.
