Hi there,

I'm Athena. I am a content marketer. I copy and paste code to render a collage of my notes online.

I express myself best when talking about products. You can psychoanalyse my choice of tools:


Favourite writing tools:
- [Bear](https://bear.app/)
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io)
- [Quiver](https://happenapps.com/#quiver)
- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/athena)
- [Substack](https://elsewhere.substack.com)

UI/UX: [Figma](figma.com/) - because it's free. Otherwise AdobeXD.

Visualistion tools:
- [Infogram](https://infogram.com/)
- [Canva](https://canva.co)

Productivity tools:
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com)
- [Calendly](calendly.com/athena-lam/)
- [Notion](https://notion.so)

Favourite marketing tools: 
- [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)
- [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com) (If there's budget.)
- [Buffer](https://buffer.com) (If there's no budget.)


Favourite code editor: [Sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/)


I like learning about backend and software architecture, especially in how they improve UX from behind the scenes. However, I am chiefly focused on thinking about how I can share information in a way that is convenient for me as a creator and viewers of the information displayed. Organisations I like products from include **[Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/)**, **[Ghost.org](https://ghost.org)**, **[Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)**.
