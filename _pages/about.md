Hi there,

I'm Athena. I am a content strategist. This is a space for me to store lists, drop notes, and experiment with basic coding. 

I express myself best when talking about products. 

Favourite writing tools:
1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. [HackMD](https://hackmd.io)
3. [Bear](https://bear.app/)
4. [Quiver](https://happenapps.com/#quiver)
5. [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/athena)
6. [Substack](https://elsewhere.substack.com)
7. Dropbox Paper

## Content Marketing
I use Wordpress, Google Analytics, [Buffer](https://buffer.com), [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com), [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)

I highly recommend to anyone who will listen these alternatives to Wordpress:
- [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org)
- [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Shopify](https://shopify.com) - instead of WooCommerce

This blog is built with the static-site generator [Jekyll (Ruby-based)](jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
I am also familiar with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), as well as [Netlify](netlify.app) and [Forrestry.io](https://forestry.io/) for deployment. See my latest projects on [my Github repo][jekyll-gh]. 

## Available for 
I like working with teams that have great people, well-built products, that fulfill a concrete purpose. You can check my [LinkedIn][linkedin]. I am available for:

- Content strategy: workshop, training, or projects
- Content marketing: website and blog setup, SEO
- Events: speaking and moderation 


If you have something else in mind, feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:athen@piccoloportfolios.com).


## Projects
In this latest page update, this is what I can remember working on:
- [**Asian Eats Directory**](https://directory.foodcoop.asia/): Developed with illustrator [Jason Li](https://hongkonggong.com/) to collect directories supporting Asian communities aroudn the world during Covid-19 and the rash of overt racism against East Asians
- [**Berlin Asian Food Map**](https://tinyurl.com/berlinasianfood)
- [**Zebra Crossing**](https://github.com/narwhalacademy/zebra-crossing) - Managing the Japanese translation and some web stuff
- [**Pride Polyphony**](https://pride-polyphony.netlify.app/) - a proof-of-concept for "audio hugs" to the LGBTQ community around the world. Developed during the UHLALA Pride Hackathon 2020 with 2 other team members. Feel free to extend this idea!

I have also written for industry publications such as [*Alliance Magazine*](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/reflecting-on-strides-in-the-impact-investment-industry/), [GreenBook](https://www.greenbook.org/mr/market-research-methodology/the-last-frontier-for-lean-methodology-iterative-questions/) and op-eds in publications such as [NÃ¼Voices](https://nuvoices.com/2019/01/16/opinion-why-women-are-leaving-hong-kong-tech-companies/) and [Hong Kong Free Press](https://hongkongfp.com/2018/11/06/grassroots-lgbt-activists-behind-celebrities-headlines/).

I try to leave presentation slides publicly available. You can find them on [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/AthenaLam/).
