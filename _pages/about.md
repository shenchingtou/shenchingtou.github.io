Hi there,

I'm Athena. I am a content marketer. This is a space for me to store lists, drop notes, and experiment with basic coding. 

I express myself best when talking about products. 

Favourite writing tools:
1. [HackMD](https://hackmd.io)
2. [Bear](https://bear.app/)
3. [Quiver](https://happenapps.com/#quiver)
4. [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/athena)
5. [Substack](https://elsewhere.substack.com)

My favourite way to write is using markdown. 

## Content Marketing
I use Wordpress, Google Analytics, [Buffer](https://buffer.com), [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com), [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)

I highly recommend to anyone who will listen these alternatives to Wordpress:
- [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org)
- [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Shopify](https://shopify.com) - instead of WooCommerce

This blog is built with the static-site generator [Jekyll (Ruby-based)](jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
I am also familiar with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), as well as [Netlify](netlify.app) and [Forrestry.io](https://forestry.io/) for deployment. See my latest projects on [my Github repo][jekyll-gh]. 

## Available for 
I like working with teams that have great people, well-built products, that fulfill a concrete purpose. You can check my [LinkedIn][linkedin]. I am available for:

- Content strategy: workshop, training, or projects
