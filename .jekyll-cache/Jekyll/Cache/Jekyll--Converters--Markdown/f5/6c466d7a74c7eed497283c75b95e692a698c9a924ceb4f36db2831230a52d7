<p>Athena was born in Canada and has spent ten years working in East Asia before moving to Germany. In 2019, she joined Berlin-based Dalia Research as a Content Strategist. Previously, she has worked in event organising, impact investment, business development for startups, and content marketing for technology companies. She has spearheaded solutions such as the LGBTQGlassdoor workplace directory for Hong Kong. She is a Board Member for Planet Ally, an LGBTQ travel advocacy NGO.</p>

<hr />
<p>I was the Content Strategist at Dalia Research. I had no explicit LGBTQ responsibilities for my work. However, one reason I decided to join Dalia was that I felt the welcoming attitudes to a queer person like myself. After joining, I realised that the company had individuals who were not explicitly out and therefore that more explicit LGBTQ+ initiatives were needed. Outside of my work duties, I worked with the companyâ€™s Office Manager and HR to create inclusive language on the company website and for company events.</p>

<p>Because my colleagues grew aware of my work, they began to approach me to develop more inclusive initiatives. For example, our VP of Engineering asked about ways to support a transgender candidate. I also did informal training with team members on pronouns, inclusive language, signage, and allyship opportunities.</p>

<hr />
<p>1) Introduced LGBTQ private &amp; public ally Slack channels as safe spaces for dialogue, learning, community-building.</p>

<p>2) Introduced explicit gender-neutral washrooms (signage, implemented by office manager).</p>

<p>3) Introduced pronoun introductions at company standup to support potential trans/non-binary colleagues</p>

<p>4) Created explicitly inclusive public events: gender-neutral signage, Berlin Code of Conduct, and explicit support for barrier-free access. Example: https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Berlin-Germany/events/268634407/</p>

<p>5) Created Pride Polyphony (https://pride-polyphony.netlify.app/). Won the UHLALA Unicorns in Tech Digital Hackathon 2020 competition.</p>

<p>6) Created the open-source, crowdsourced directory LGBTQGlassdoor (repository: https://github.com/oursky/lgbtq-glassdoor) with a previous Hong Kong-based client, Oursky, which won The Economist #WorkWithPride 2018 competition and was presented at The Economist Pride and Prejudice LGBTQ global conference.</p>
