I like to solve problems and start projects, especially if the solution is simple.

I like learning about backend and software architecture, especially in how they improve UX from behind the scenes. However, I am chiefly focused on thinking about how I can share information in a way that is convenient for me as a creator and viewers of the information displayed. Organisations I like products from include **Foundation**, **Ghost.org**, **Craft CMS**.
