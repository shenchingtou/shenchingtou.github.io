Google searching for China’s LGBTQ content is not optimal. A lot of content, especially around same-sex relationships and sex in general, are censored and content creators are constantly re-uploading their stuff. 

The good news is that since I compiled my early lists, I've found better and more interesting stuff. Unfortunately, it takes a while to update and content is being deleted. In the meantime, I'll direct you to my blog posts that I've placed onto the web archive:
