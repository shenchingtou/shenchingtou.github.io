## The Hackathon

The [Sex Tech Hackathon](https://hack.touchyfeely.tech/) co-hosted by [Touchy Feely Tech](https://hack.touchyfeely.tech/), [Hervisions](https://hervisions.world/), [Kinky Makers](https://kinkymakers.com/), [Creative Code Utrecht](https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/) took place on May 1-2, 2021 as part of the Rainbows End online festival. It was the second Sex Tech Hackathon, back within months of the first by popular demand. I found out about it through sex tech writer, [Carolyn Stransky](https://twitter.com/carolstran/status/1388772122940649475?s=20), on Twitter.

The hackathon's consortium of organizers invited "artists, academics, activists, thinkers and tinkerers from all backgrounds and perspectives to take part" and also had numerous talks by makers and people in sex tech. I joined out of curiosity because I knew nothing about the topic and almost treated it like a conference.

This year, I teamed up again with my friend [Ghonche Tavoosi](https://twitter.com/glenatavoosi), podcaster, feminist, activist, product manager and community organizer extraordinare. Last year, we built a working prototype of audio hugs for the LGBTQ community, [Pride Polyphony](https://pride-polyphony.netlify.app/) with [Emma Lawson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-c-lawson/). This year, our friend [Thomas Liano](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6794673645546430464/) wanted to address the gap between people wanting to connect to their bodies or find more ways of experiencing pleasure and the availability of inclusive resources to do so.

For the Sex Tech Hackathon, the three themes we could work with were:
- Fair Futures
- Sexual Health = Health
- Dream Devices

It was an open field of possibilites for sex to become more accessible, inclusive, and relevant for people. A note that this hackathon (refreshingly for me) did not have a business component / emphasis.

## The Problem

Problem that we wanted to address at the individual level was that many people may not feel entirely connected to their body or the permission to feel bodily pleasure. The messages that we receive from media and our suroundings has, in many ways, limited how we experience our body, and more precisely, how we experience bodily pleasure. 

The big picture problem that we wanted to address was the silos within the "experience economy" that has alienated many people and, since 2020 with the pandemic, left people with unsatiated desires. To put it another way, Covid-19 restrictions have shown us the limits of an economic model that focuses on consuming the experiences we are given access to, the ones that are sold to us and that we can afford, **instead of focusing on how we experience things**.

### What people shared with us

To get more insights into this, **we did a survey** in under 24 hours. 

Of our 70+ respondents, 95% said that can experience pleasure through their body. In addition 51% also said that the way they experience it has been shaped by media and education, and 49% felt that these two have limited the way they experience pleasure.

Finally, **69% of people strongly felt that they wanted to try new ways to experience pleasure through their bodies**. I have taken strongly to be 9 or 10 out of 10.

Respondents included friends, friends of friends, and strangers online. We asked them to answer anonymously to protect privacy. You can have a look at the spread of data here:

And I feel limited in the ways I can experience physical pleasure based on what is represented in media and education. ](/assets/images/projects/sensploration-survey-results-1.png)

![Sensploration survey responses to the statements I feel I can experience pleasure through my body and I would like to try new ways to experience pleasure through my body](/assets/images/projects/sensploration-survey-results-2.png)

**What some survey respondents shared about media and education**
>_"I feel like I have worked on new ways to experience pleasure but I feel like I lack a framework for it and especially to do it with partners."

>"_I felt like this was true in the past i.e thinking I was abnormal for not orgasming during penetrative penis in Vagina Sex. However after learning about pleasure on my own terms this has changed my experience drastically._"

>"*Being queer (and particularly bisexual) isn't always well represented (or represented at all) in media or education.*"

> _“I think the default of "here's what I can expect to be the range of possibilities" is very much shaped by the media.”_

**Some responses to experiencing and trying new ways of experiencing pleasure**
>"_I'm interested in moving beyond orgasms and finding different ways to receive pleasure_"

> _“As a sexual trauma survivor I know I am disconnected from sensations so I would like to explore ways to feel. “__

> "*I think knowing how to give yourself pleasure helps you connect with yourself, and it's a part of connecting with others also. Receiving pleasure is a way to connect.*"


To summarize, we had two hypotheses:
1. A lot of people can probably not only have better sex, but have access to more ways of feeling pleasure through their body (sexual or not). 
2. Mindfulness (and connection to the body) is a huge industry; the experience industry is huge; the sex industry is huge. There's a market for this type of content, whichever industry it sits in, but ideally at the intersection of the three.

## The Product

Though there are a number of ways to address the problem we wanted to solve, we chose to do it through a mobile application. We wanted envision an app that is radically inclusive in how people are invited to explore experiences, sensuality, and potentially sexuality.

We wanted to focus on activivities that offer people new approaches to explore and enjoy their body using the five senses *and the intersections between them*.

**To do this, we designed an app that:**
1. Allows for guest access (for privacy) and logins (for personalisation)
2. Has a guided start with a touch-based activity
3. Gives opportunities for user feedback so people can note what they like and don't like (for future personalisation)
4. When the user returns to the main page they can see the touch bubble that they have just practised has grown to show progress. And new categories are unlocked.
5. As a user explores more activites, each sense bubble grows bigger and eventually overlap, with new intersectional categories are unlocked.

As an example, touch can begin with light touches, deep touches. It can include pressing, holding, pinching, and tapping. But touch can also expand to materials, which can have its own subcategories such as textures and temperatures. Touch can also include movement and toys. 

The goal of the app is to give people a framework through each of the senses to explore their and their partners’ bodies. In the long run, the user’s knowledge of what they enjoy is expanded, and they have the tools needed to openly communicate what they enjoy to others. By focusing on senses and activcities, we remap how we think about pleasure and intimacy, dismantling stigmas, shame, and taboos.

**We also wanted to intentionally create a more inclusive app that could**

- speak to different gender identities (without alienating)
- be mindful of how people may or may not relate to different parts of their bodies (for example, trans and genderqueer folks)
- get away from gendered descriptions or roles (not heteronormative)
- not limit concepts as sexual acts (for ACE folks)
- be inclusive of bodies with different abilities
- be inclusive of different types of bodies, shapes, and skin colours 
- be accessible to people who may have difficulty reading (therefore the content would have both transcript and audio)

Rather than seeing all of these factors as limitations, we saw them as opportunities to design a better product from the beginning.

## The Process

Our process of designing and preparing our presentation had structure, but also required back and forths.

Working backward from the presentation, we needed to find a way to convey our idea succinctly. The structure that lends itself well to a 5-10 minute presentation is (not surprisingly), a startup pitch. This meant that we structured it as:
- The problem we wanted to solve
- Finding data (quantiative and qualitative)
- Conceptualising a solution
- Deciding on the prototype
- Researching bigger market opportunities
- Preparing for the pitch
- Eating, baking, and sleeping



2. We built a mobile app mockup of our concept using [Figma](https://figma.com).
