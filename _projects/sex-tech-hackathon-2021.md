### The problem
The idea was that many people may not feel entirely connected to their body or the permission to feel bodily pleasure. We wanted envision an app that is radically inclusive in how people are invited to explore experiences, sensuality, and potentially sexuality. 

To summarize, we had two hypotheses:
1. A lot of people can probably not only have better sex, but have access to more ways of feeling pleasure through their body (sexual or not). 
2. Mindfulness (and connection to the body) is a huge industry; the experience industry is huge; the sex industry is huge. There's a market for this type of content, whichever industry it sits in, but ideally at the intersection of the three.

### The solution
![Sensploration app mockup with two smartphones. One phone shows 5 bubbles for each of the 5 senses, touch, feel, taste, hear, and smell. The other phone has a playlist for Touch including light, deep, move, and toys](/assets/images/projects/Sensploration-app.jpg)
Our solution came in two parts. 
1. To collect data on our idea that people wanted to have better sex or find more ways to experience physical pleasure, we did a survey and received 70 responses in under 24 hours. 
2. We built a mobile app mockup of our concept using [Figma](https://figma.com).

**The App**

Though there are a number of ways to address the problem we wanted to solve, we chose to do it through a mobile application. Even  then, there are a number of ways to create a solution. We decided to create an activity-based app that offers people new approaches to explore and enjoy their body using the 5 senses *and the intersections between them*.

The goal of the app is to give people a framework through each of the senses to explore their and their partners’ bodies. In the long run, the user’s knowledge of what they enjoy is expanded, and they have the tools needed to openly communicate what they enjoy to others. This approach remaps how we think about pleasure and intimacy, dismantling stigmas, shame, and taboos. 

We also wanted to create an app that was:

- inclusive of all gender identities
- be mindful of how people may or may not relate to different parts of their bodies (for example, trans and genderqueer folks)
- get away from gendered descriptions or roles (not heteronormative)
- not limit concepts as sexual acts (for ACE folks)
- be inclusive of bodies with different abilities
- be inclusive of different types of bodies, shapes, and skin colours 
- be accessible to people who may have difficulty reading (therefore the content would have both transcript and audio)

Below is a walkthrough of the app. We presented this on Sunday and are honoured to have tied for 2nd place.
